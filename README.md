# EFIGI-Galaxy-Classification
The project aims to classify the Galaxies based on their morphological properties
by making use of Machine Learning techniques. This project presents a new method
for classifying galaxies using the EFIGI attributes data. For this purpose, we have
used various feature selection and geneartion methods alongwith a recent algorithm
called SMOTE, which is an oversampling method. Decision Tree classifier, Random
Forest classifier, Gradient Boosting classifier have been considered for the classification. We have also considered the classes in two different scenarios, one with five
classes and the other with 18 classes which are the subclasses of the previously mentioned five classes. With these methods, we have acquired a mean cross-validation
score of 87% on the five classes scenario and 42% on the 18 classes.

The overview of our project.
